## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The importance of css layout and the naming in html.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="card"> </div>
</div>
```
```css
.container{
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 10% auto;
  padding: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

Right now, I'm using CSS Flexbox but for future projects I want to use CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for CSS Flexbos.
